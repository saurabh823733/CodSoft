Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning-

This project is based on the famous Iris flower dataset. The aim of this project is to classify iris flowers into different species using their sepal and petal measurements. This project helped me understand the basic workflow of a machine learning classification problem.

Problem Statementn-

Given the measurements of an iris flower, the model should be able to predict its species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Dataset Information-

The dataset contains 150 records with the following columns:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Species (target)


Approach Used-

-Loaded the dataset using pandas

-Performed basic data exploration and null value checking

-Visualized data using pair plots

-Selected input features and target variable

-Split the dataset into training and testing data

-Applied Logistic Regression for classification

-Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report

Algorithm Used

Logistic Regression

It is a simple and effective supervised learning algorithm that works well for multi-class classification problems like the Iris dataset.

Tools and Libraries-

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn


Results-

The model gives high accuracy (around 95–100%) on the test dataset.
It is able to correctly classify most of the iris flower samples.

Conclusion-
Through this project, I learned:How to work with real datasets,Basic data preprocessing,Train-test split concept,How classification models work,How to evaluate model performance,How to visualize data for better understanding
This project helped me build a strong foundation in machine learning classification. It gave me hands-on experience in implementing an end-to-end ML workflow using Python.
