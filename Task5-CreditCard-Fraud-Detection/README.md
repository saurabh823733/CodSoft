Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions
using machine learning techniques. The dataset was preprocessed and
normalized, and class imbalance was handled using SMOTE.

Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were trained to classify
transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Model performance was evaluated
using precision, recall, and F1-score.

This project highlights the importance of handling imbalanced data in
real-world financial applications.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
