# Movie Rating Prediction using Machine Learning-

This project was completed as part of the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**.  
The objective of this project is to predict the rating of a movie based on various features such as genre, director, actors, duration, and number of votes using machine learning regression techniques.

# 🤖 Machine Learning Model-
- Model Used: Random Forest Regressor
- Reason: It handles non-linear data well and provides better performance compared to basic regression models.

---

# 📊 Evaluation Metrics-
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

---

# 🚀 Future Improvements-
- Use advanced encoding techniques
- Include movie review sentiment analysis
- Try other regression models
- Improve feature selection

---

# ✅ Conclusion-
This project provided hands-on experience with regression modeling and real-world data preprocessing. It improved my understanding of machine learning workflows and strengthened my practical skills in data analysis.
