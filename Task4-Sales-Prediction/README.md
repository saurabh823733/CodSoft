📊 Task 4: Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

📌 Objective-

The objective of this task is to predict product sales based on advertising expenditure across different platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
This project demonstrates how machine learning can help businesses make data-driven decisions and optimize advertising strategies.

📁 Dataset-

The dataset used in this project contains information about advertising budgets and corresponding sales.

Features:

TV – Advertising spend on TV

Radio – Advertising spend on Radio

Newspaper – Advertising spend on Newspaper

Target:

Sales – Number of units sold


🛠 Technologies Used-

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn


⚙️ Approach-

Loaded and explored the advertising dataset

Performed basic data analysis and visualization

Checked correlations between advertising platforms and sales

Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, and R² score

Made sales predictions using new input values


📈 Model Used-

Linear Regression

This model was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness for predicting continuous values like sales.

✅ Results-

The model achieved good accuracy with a high R² score, indicating a strong relationship between advertising expenditure and sales.
TV advertising showed the strongest impact on sales compared to other platforms.
